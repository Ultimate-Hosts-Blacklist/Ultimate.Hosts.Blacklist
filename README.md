************************************************
## WHAT IS A HOSTS FILE?

A hosts file, named `hosts` (with no file extension), is a plain-text file
used by all operating systems to map hostnames to IP addresses.

In most operating systems, the `hosts` file is preferential to `DNS`.
Therefore if a domain name is resolved by the `hosts` file, the request never
leaves your computer.

Having a smart `hosts` file goes a long way towards blocking malware, adware, ransomware, porn and other nuisance web sites.

A hosts file like this causes any lookups to any of the listed domains to resolve back to your localhost so it prevents any outgoing connections to the listed domains.

************************************************
## WHAT IS A HOSTS.DENY FILE?

A hosts file, named `hosts.deny` is a plain-text file for unix based operating systems which blocks a list of IP addresses on the outside of your network from gaining access to your computer. A `hosts.deny` file will not work on a Windows operating system.

************************************************
## WHERE DO I PUT THIS ON MY COMPUTER?
To modify your current `hosts` file, look for it in the following places and modify it with a text
editor.

**Linux, Mac OS X, iOS, Android**: `/etc/hosts`
**Linux, Mac OS X, iOS, Android**: `/etc/hosts.deny`

**Windows Systems**: `%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`
