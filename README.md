## WHAT IS A HOSTS FILE?

A hosts file, named `hosts` (with no file extension), is a plain-text file used by all operating systems to map hostnames to IP addresses.

In most operating systems, the `hosts` file is preferential to `DNS`. Therefore if a domain name is resolved by the `hosts` file, the request never leaves your computer.

Having a smart `hosts` file goes a long way towards blocking malware, adware, ransomware, porn and other nuisance web sites.

A hosts file like this causes any lookups to any of the listed domains to resolve back to your localhost so it prevents any outgoing connections to the listed domains.

For example, to drop all requests to certain domains or servers, adding lines to your hosts file as below will achieve this for you. You can create your own custom hosts or simply use ours which covers you for well over 1 million bad domains and web sites out there.

```
# Block Bad Domains and Servers with Hosts File
0.0.0.0 doubleclick.net
0.0.0.0 18chinese.com
0.0.0.0 gatekeeper.tss.net
0.0.0.0 www.gatekeeper.tss.net
0.0.0.0 cdn.gatekeeper.tss.net
0.0.0.0 youporn.com
0.0.0.0 www.youporn.com
0.0.0.0 x-lime.net
0.0.0.0 www.x-lime.net
# etc ... etc .... etc ...
```

It is important to note that a `hosts` file cannot understand wild card domains. So adding `0.0.0.0 *.doubleclick.net` will not work. You must specify each and every variation of a domain name that is in use and up to no good.

Lucky for you our massive hosts file compiled from over 25 independent data input sources already does this for you. So it is as simple as downloading our `hosts` file and keeping it up to date as we update the hosts file several times a week as new threats emerg.

---

## RECOMMENDATION FOR USING `0.0.0.0` instead of `127.0.0.1`

Most host files traditionally use `127.0.0.1` as the loopback address, to establish an IP connection to the local machine.

I prefer the use of `0.0.0.0`, which is defined as a non-routable meta-address. Using `0.0.0.0` is also faster because there's no wait for a timeout resolution. It also does not interfere with any web servers that may be running on the local system.

For many windows operating systems however `127.0.0.1` does appear to work slightly better and which is why our Windows version of the hosts file uses `127.0.0.1` as the loopback address.

---

## WHAT IS A HOSTS.DENY FILE?

A hosts file, named `hosts.deny` is a plain-text file for Linux/Unix based operating systems only which blocks a list of IP addresses on the outside of your network from gaining any access to your computer. A `hosts.deny` file will not work on a Windows operating system.

---

## WHAT IS A SUPERHOSTS.DENY FILE? **I've never heard of such a thing ??**

The superhosts.deny file is simply named `superhosts.deny` but is actually just a normal `hosts.deny` file which is a plain-text file for Linux/Unix based operating systems which blocks a list of IP addresses or hosts (domains) on the outside of your network from gaining any access to your computer. If you want to use this `superhosts.deny` file simply rename it to `hosts.deny` and place it in your `/etc/` folder on your Linux/Unix operating system. A `hosts.deny` file will not work on a Windows operating system.

---

## WHERE DO I PUT THIS ON MY COMPUTER?

To modify your current `hosts` file, look for it in the following places and modify it with a text editor.

**PLEASE NOTE:** On all operating systems you need administrative access to modify the hosts file. You can Google on how to do this for your particular operating system.

**Linux, Mac OS X, iOS, Android**: `/etc/hosts`

**Linux, Mac OS X, iOS, Android**: `/etc/hosts.deny`

**Windows Systems**: `%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts` **[Try the Windows Installer Batch Script](https://github.com/Ultimate-Hosts-Blacklist/Ultimate.Hosts.Blacklist/blob/master/Installer-Windows/windows-install-hosts.bat)<br>**
