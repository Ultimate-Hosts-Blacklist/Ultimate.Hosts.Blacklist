## WHAT IS A HOSTS FILE?

A hosts file, named `hosts` (with no file extension), is a plain-text file
used by all operating systems to map hostnames to IP addresses.

In most operating systems, the `hosts` file is preferential to `DNS`.
Therefore if a domain name is resolved by the `hosts` file, the request never
leaves your computer.

Having a smart `hosts` file goes a long way towards blocking malware, adware, ransomware, porn and other nuisance web sites.

A hosts file like this causes any lookups to any of the listed domains to resolve back to your localhost so it prevents any outgoing connections to the listed domains.

************************************************
## WHAT IS A HOSTS.DENY FILE?

A hosts file, named `hosts.deny` is a plain-text file for Linux/Unix based operating systems only which blocks a list of IP addresses on the outside of your network from gaining any access to your computer. A `hosts.deny` file will not work on a Windows operating system.

************************************************
## WHAT IS A SUPERHOSTS.DENY FILE? **I've never heard of that ??**

The superhosts.deny file is simply named `superhosts.deny` but is actually just a normal `hosts.deny` file which is a plain-text file for Linux/Unix based operating systems which blocks a list of IP addresses or hosts (domains) on the outside of your network from gaining any access to your computer. If you want to user this `superhosts.deny` file simply rename it to `hosts.deny` and place it in your `/etc/` folder on your Linux/Unix operating system. A `hosts.deny` file will not work on a Windows operating system.

************************************************
## WHERE DO I PUT THIS ON MY COMPUTER?

To modify your current `hosts` file, look for it in the following places and modify it with a text
editor. 

**PLEASE NOTE:** On all operating systems you need administrative access to modify the hosts file. You can Google on how to do this for your particular operating system.

**Linux, Mac OS X, iOS, Android**: `/etc/hosts`

**Linux, Mac OS X, iOS, Android**: `/etc/hosts.deny`

**Windows Systems**: `%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`

## WHERE CAN I DOWNLOAD THE RAW UNZIPPED FILES FROM?

To keep this Github repo small, all files are provided in a zip only format. Some people however require their Pi-Holes or other systems to automatically download a raw file once a week or so as an update. For your convenience you can download these raw files at the following links. These links below will always contain tha latest updated version of these files.
